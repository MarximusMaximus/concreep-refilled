Date: 2023-09-12
  Changes:
    - Toggle to not deconstruct entitities.
Date: 2021-11-29
  Changes:
    - FORKED from Concreep 1.4.6
    - Lots of refactoring
    - Removed under roboport pattern matching creeping
    - Merged in support for filling water tiles with landfill
    - Added more settings to allow better control of how the creep creeps
    - Mod now wakes up after a little while to check if there is work to do after it's completed
      work (so if the environment around a roboport changes, it will get handled without
      needing to remove and replace roboport)
    - Wakeup re-scan logic is spread across multiple frames for very low UPS hit
